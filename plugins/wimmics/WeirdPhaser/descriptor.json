    "description": "Weird Phaser is a stereo phase shifter based on SSB (single side band) modulation. Unlike Stereo Frequency Shifter, Weird Phaser uses a single LFO which has a fixed phase offset for the right hand channel, causing some interesting between the ears spatial effects at its maximum settting. Weird Phaser also has feedback for a more pronounced effect. Authors: Michel Buffa for making it a WAM, Q. Beauchet for GUI improvements, original Faust Code : Oli Larkin",
