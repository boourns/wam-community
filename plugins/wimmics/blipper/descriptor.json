    "description": "Blipper is an Envelope Follower which controls the pitch of a triangle oscillator. It is a rough emulation of some of the features of the BOSS PC-2 Percussion Synthesiser. Arthur Russell used something like this to create interesting percussion parts on his records e.g. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEZevPziZhY>. It works nicely with drums. Authors: Michel Buffa for making it a WAM, Q. Beauchet for GUI improvements, original Faust Code : Oli Larkin",
